# Working in this repo (team rules — read first)

Five people work on this code and share ONE Claude account, so a session
cannot tell who is driving it. These rules keep us from overwriting each
other's work. They apply to people and to Claude alike.

## Branches: only the owner pushes `hardening`

`hardening` is protected on GitHub: **only dhanuvagman006 can push to it**
(no force-push, no delete). Everyone else works on their own branch and
opens a pull request; the owner reviews and merges.

Each teammate has ONE branch of their own, in both repos, that only they
(and the owner) can push to:

| Person | Branch    |
|--------|-----------|
| Allen   (allenlobo31)      | `allen`   |
| Manish  (Manish-G-suvarna) | `manish`  |
| Karthik (Karthikshettyhub) | `karthik` |
| Chirag  (Chiragkulal07)    | `chirag`  |

Work only on your own branch. It builds nothing, deploys nothing and sends
nothing to testers, so you cannot break the app for anyone else there.

1. Switch to your branch and bring in the latest `hardening`:
   `git checkout <you> && git pull --rebase origin <you> && git pull --rebase origin hardening`
2. Make your change. Commit small, clear commits.
3. Run the checks (below). Do not push code that fails them.
4. Before **every** push, bring in the latest again:
   `git pull --rebase origin hardening`, resolve conflicts, re-run the checks.
5. Push: `git push origin <you>`. Never push to `hardening` or
   `hardening-test` — GitHub refuses it ("protected branch").
6. When it works, open a pull request into `hardening`:
   `gh pr create --base hardening --head <you> --fill` — say what changed
   and how you tested it. The owner reviews and merges it.
7. **Never force-push** a branch someone else also works on, and never
   rewrite commits already on GitHub. The `.githooks/pre-push` hook refuses
   a push that would drop commits already on the remote; `./setup.sh`
   switches it on. Do not bypass it with `--no-verify`.
8. Check `git config user.name` is YOUR name on your machine, so the
   history shows who did what (the shared Claude account does not).

Claude: never push to `hardening` or `hardening-test` unless the person at
the keyboard is the owner and asked for it. Otherwise ask who is at the
keyboard, work on THEIR branch from the table above, push it, and open a PR.
Never push to another teammate's branch, never merge a PR, and never change
branch protection, collaborators, secrets or workflows for a teammate.

## Pushing sends a build to testers

Every push to `hardening` builds an APK (signed with the team debug key) in GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/distribute.yml`) and sends it to the Firebase App
Distribution group `testers`. Push to `hardening-test` to send a build to
the owner only (dhanushinsit@gmail.com) first. Other branches build nothing.

## Secrets — both repos are PUBLIC

Never commit `google-services.json`, `.env*` files, keystores,
`android/key.properties` or `android/app-check-debug-token.txt`. They live
in the team Bitwarden vault and `./setup.sh` writes them locally.

## Checks before pushing

- `flutter analyze` — no new errors or warnings
- `flutter test`
- Java 17 for builds: `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64`

## Setup

`./setup.sh` (see SETUP.md) resets both repos to `origin/hardening` (commit
your branch's work first — uncommitted changes are backed up, then
discarded), writes
the secrets from Bitwarden and runs the backend and the app.
